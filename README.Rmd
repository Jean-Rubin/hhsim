The goal of hhsim is to simulate household dynamics by allowing individuals to appear, change households or disappear from the observed population.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hhsim from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Jean-Rubin/hhsim")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(hhsim)
## basic example code

hh_gen <- hh_geometric(2L)
population_init <- generate_population(n = 10L, hh_gen = hh_gen)
population_init |>
  introduce(n = 5L, hh_gen = hh_gen) |>
  evolve(prop = 0.2) |>
  remove(n = 5L)
```
